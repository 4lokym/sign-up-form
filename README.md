# sign-up-form

These are all the things i've learned and implemented in this exercise:

-Flexbox
-Form and input properties, form validation
-Responsivness for different screens(for example mobile devices)
-A light and dark theme. May have support issues for your browser (work in progress...)
-Personalized fonts

The font i'm using is from spotify.
